      `**Overview**
Kenya's latest Economic Update paints a mixed but improving picture. Output growth is gathering momentum on the back of a rebound in construction and easing financial conditions, while inflation remains within target and the currency stable. At the same time, fiscal pressures are intensifying as revenue underperforms and the deficit widens above target.

**Key developments**
- The World Bank projects average growth of 4.9% for 2025-2027, supported by easing monetary conditions.
- FY2024/25 fiscal deficit widened to 5.9% of GDP, above the original 4.3% target.
- Credit growth rebounded to 5% year-on-year by September 2025.

**Quote**
"Fiscal pressures are intensifying." 

**Why it matters**
Kenya is a bellwether for East African macro trends. Stronger growth helps private investment and job creation, but persistent fiscal slippage can crowd out credit and weaken long-term stability. The report's emphasis on pro-competitive reforms signals a push toward productivity-led growth rather than debt-led expansion.

**What to watch**
Markets will focus on revenue measures and expenditure discipline in the coming budget cycle, alongside signals on debt sustainability and the pace of structural reforms.`

      `**Overview**
The IMF's 2025 Article IV highlights Rwanda's continued resilience, noting robust services and construction activity and inflation within the target band. The Fund stresses that rebuilding fiscal and external buffers is now the priority as import demand and public investment have widened external balances.

**Key developments**
- Real GDP grew 7.2% in 2024 and the first half of 2025 on the rebased series.
- The current account deficit widened as consumer and capital goods imports rose.
- The IMF urges stronger domestic revenue mobilization and spending efficiency.

**Quote**
"Rwanda's economy remains strong and resilient."

**Why it matters**
Rwanda is one of the region's fastest-growing economies, and its policy mix influences investor confidence across East Africa. Consolidation could slow headline growth but improve debt sustainability and resilience to shocks.

**What to watch**
Fiscal consolidation measures, exchange rate flexibility, and progress on major infrastructure projects will shape the 2026 outlook.`

      `**Overview**
Uganda's 2025 Post-Financing Assessment confirms robust growth and contained inflation, supported by strong exports and improved reserves. The IMF underscores the importance of fiscal adjustment and policy vigilance, citing oil project delays and external shocks as the principal risks.

**Key developments**
- Foreign exchange reserves rose significantly in 2025, supported by strong coffee exports and portfolio inflows.
- The IMF assesses Uganda's repayment capacity as adequate but exposed to shocks.
- Authorities reaffirmed commitment to fiscal adjustment and exchange rate flexibility.

**Quote**
"Uganda's post-pandemic economic performance has been robust."

**Why it matters**
Uganda's macro stability supports investor confidence and regional trade. The oil timeline is the pivotal variable: it can lift growth and revenues, but delays could strain public finances and financing conditions.

**What to watch**
Execution of fiscal reforms, export performance, and updates on the oil pipeline and production start date.`

      `**Overview**
Africa's foreign investment surged to a record in 2024, led by large project finance and policy reforms aimed at investor facilitation. UNCTAD notes that even excluding a major megaproject, inflows still rose, signaling a broader rebound.

**Key developments**
- FDI inflows rose 75% to $97 billion in 2024, reaching 6% of global FDI.
- Excluding a large Egypt-related megadeal, inflows still climbed about 12% to $62 billion.
- Investment facilitation policies made up a large share of pro-investor measures.

**Quote**
"Foreign investment in Africa surged by 75% to reach an all-time high of $97 billion in 2024."

**Why it matters**
Record inflows can catalyze infrastructure, energy, and industrial projects that create jobs and lift productivity. The quality and distribution of investment across sectors and countries remains the central question for long-term impact.

**What to watch**
Whether project finance translates into on-the-ground execution, and if greenfield and manufacturing investments return at scale.`

The African Development Bank's new report points to a stronger growth path for the continent, with inflation expected to ease and fiscal positions gradually improving. However, the report cautions that the pace of growth is still below the level needed for rapid poverty reduction.

**Key developments**
- Growth is projected to accelerate to 4.1% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026.
- Inflation is expected to ease from 18.6% in 2024 to 12.6% in 2025-2026.
- Fiscal deficits are projected to narrow to 4.1% of GDP by 2025-2026.

**Quote**
"Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 4.1 percent in 2025 and 4.4 percent in 2026."

**Why it matters**
Improving macro stability creates room for private investment, but the report warns that structural reforms are still essential to translate growth into jobs and income gains.

**What to watch**
Policy follow-through on revenue mobilization, productivity reforms, and climate-related investment.`

      `**Overview**
The IMF expects momentum to build across the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan (MENAP) in 2025, driven by higher oil output for exporters and stronger domestic demand for importers. Inflation trends are diverging, and structural reform remains a central policy focus.

**Key developments**
- The IMF projects MENAP growth of 3.2% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026.
- Oil exporters benefit from increased output as OPEC+ cuts unwind.
